    Update previous track button to skip to the begining of the current track
        if more than 10 seconds have elapsed.

    Fix to timer being fired when a device (iPod, CD, HDD, etc..) is mounted.
    An infinite loop was possible that would cause the available playlists to
        not be updated when changes occurred.
    If two consecutive tracks had the same duration, the track info would not
        change when the track changed. Corrected by using the id from iTunes
        rather than the duration.
