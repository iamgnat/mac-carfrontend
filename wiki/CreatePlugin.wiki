#summary How to create a CarFrontEnd plugin

== Purpose ==
This section will show you how to setup and build a Xcode project to create a CarFrontEnd plugin, then install it.

== Prerequisites ==
You must have CarFrontEndAPI framework installed on your development host. For the purposes of this discussion, it will be assumed that you have installed it as _/Library/Frameworks/CarFrontEndAPI.framework_.

You should also be using the latest version of [http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/ Xcode] which is available from Apple's developer website.

== Project Creation ==
  # Start XCode (_/Developer/Applications/Xcode_)
  # Create a new Project (_File->New Project..._)
  # Select *Cocoa Bundle* as the project type.
  # Give your project a name and location.
  # Edit the Project Settings (_Project->Edit Project Settings..._)
    * General Tab
      # Set the Cross-Development _Target to 10.4 (Universal)_.
  # Edit the Active Target Settings (_Project->Edit Active Target_).
    * Build Tab
      # Set the _Configuration_ to "All Configurations".
      # Set _Show_ to "All Settings" if it is not already.
      # Set the _Architectures_ to "ppc i386". (Universal build)
      # Set _Mach-O Type_ to "Bundle".
      # Set _Wrapper Extension_ to "cfep".
  # Add the CarFrontEndAPI framework to your project.
    # Right click on _Frameworks_ in the "Groups & Files".
    # Select "Add->Existing Frameworks...".
    # Navigate to where you installed CarFrontEndAPI (the default location is _/Library/Frameworks/CarFrontEndAPI.framework_) and select it.
    # Click the "ADD" button with no other changes.
  # Add your primary class to the Project
    # Right click on _Classes_ in the "Groups & Files" area.
    # Select "Add->New File...".
    # Select "Objective-C Class"
    # Give the new class a name.
  # Edit your header file.
    # Add the import for `<CarFrontEndAPI/CarFrontEndAPI.h>`
    # Update the `@interface` line to include the _CarFrontEndProtocol_ designation.
    # Add the required methods to conform to the protocol.
    # Go ahead and add an action so we can add a button.
    * You header should look something like:
      {{{#import <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>
      #import <CarFrontEndAPI/CarFrontEndAPI.h>

      @interface SamplePlugin : NSObject <CarFrontEndProtocol> {

      }

      - (NSString *) name;
      - (void) initalize;
      - (NSImage *) pluginButtonImage;
      - (NSView *) contentViewForSize: (NSSize) size;
      - (void) removePluginFromView;

      - (IBAction) buttonClicked: (id) sender;

      @end
      }}}
