#summary Requesting new features

= Introduction =

How to request a specific feature.

= Details =

CarFrontEnd is designed to give the end user exactly what they want (if it is available), but no more. The goal is to reduce the overhead of the program and ease the end user experience by not cluttering the application with features they don't need or want.

To that end, most feature requests will be for new plugin modules rather than changes to the application shell itself. If there is some specific functionality you would like, submit a "Type-Enhancement" Issue request for it. Please include as many details as you can about the desired functionality.

The request will be reviewed and given a priority based on the level of interest of the contributing members at that time. Even if your request is given a low priority, if someone else joins the project that wants to specifically work on your request it will get attention.
