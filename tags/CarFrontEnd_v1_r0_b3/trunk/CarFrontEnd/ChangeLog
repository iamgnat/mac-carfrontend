    Added driver side selection option to the Menu view.
    Updated the Volume window to pop to the bottom of the screen rather than
        the center. This should make it easier for the user to use.
    Added a title bar to the main window if it is built in Debug mode.

    Fix to timer being fired when a device (iPod, CD, HDD, etc..) is mounted.
    An infinite loop was possible that would cause the available playlists to
        not be updated when changes occurred.
    If two consecutive tracks had the same duration, the track info would not
        change when the track changed. Corrected by using the id from iTunes
        rather than the duration.
