2008-03-09 - 1.0a10 - gnat
    Fixed play/pause bug in iTunesMusicPlayer where it could not start playing
        a track after the next or prev track buttons were used while the current
        track was paused.
    Added Current Track Index and Playlist track count to iTunesMusicPlayer.
2008-01-27 - 1.0a9 - gnat
    Fixed placement of elapsed time and track length fields in the iTunes
        plugin when the height of the screen is greater than 480.
    Added -mainWindow method to the PluginManager to provide a pointer to the 
        main CarFrontEnd window.
    Added support for Plugins to respond to -viewWasMadeVisible and 
        -viewWillBeRemovedFromView.
2007-11-09 - 1.0a8 - gnat
    Added CFEApplication sub-class of NSApplication.
    Added Key Bindings methods to PluginManager.
    Added Key Bindings to SystemManager, PluginManager, and iTunesViewController.
    Fixed typo in the changeRepeatMode: method of iTunesViewController.
    Added images for Volume control.
    Updated the volume window to span the entire width of the screen to make
        fine tuning with large fingers easier.
    Updated the volume window controls to be volume up/down vs mute/max.
    Added images to the iTunes plugin.
    The main window no longer is a shielding window (e.g. always on top) when
        using a Debug build.
2007-09-21 - 1.0a7 - gnat
    Updated openVolumeWindow: to bring the volume window to the front if it is
        still open (e.g. the window has been hidden and the user clicks the
        volume button again).
    Added PluginManager Protocols to the PluginManager object.
    Added CFEMessage notification and observation to all objects and the
        iTunesMusicPlayer plugin.
    Updated the System Menu and iTunesMusicPlayer content views to adjust for
        driver side changes.
2007-09-05 - 1.0a6 - gnat
    Updated SplashView to reflect version change.
    See CarFrontEndAPI for changes.
2007-08-21 - 1.0a5 - gnat
    BUG: On larger displays the buttons were not working. The buttons were bound
        to the wrong side of the screen causing them to be pulled under the
        splash view. Corrected the bindings.
    BUG: Artifacting on some displays when the driver side is swapped. Added
        setNeedsDisplay: calls to the mainView which appears to have corrected
        the issue in the test case.
2007-08-19 - 1.0a4 - gnat
    BUG: Inadvertantly (ok, I was screwing around and forgot about it) changed
        the AppleScript for the Next Track button that caused the screen to
        go black. Returned the script to the proper state.
    BUG: Due to the 1.0a3 NIB changes, the QuickSlot buttons were not calling
        their plugins. Relinked the buttons to the proper action.
2007-08-19 - 1.0a3 - gnat
    Added driver side selection option to the Menu view.
    Updated the Volume window to pop to the bottom of the screen rather than
        the center. This should make it easier for the user to use.
    Added a title bar to the main window if it is built in Debug mode.
2007-08-08 - 1.0a2 - gnat
    Update previous track button to skip to the begining of the current track
        if more than 10 seconds have elapsed.
    Added PluginListView to manage new plugin management.
    Updated MainMenu.nib to add a PluginListView to the SystemView view for
        displaying the loaded plugins.
    Updated MainMenu.nib to change the 6 plugin buttons in the MainView to 
        3 QuickSlot buttons to act as quick access to commonly used plugins.
    Updated PluginManager.h/m to add new PluginListView and QuickSlot logic.
    Updated MainViewController to add support for preference management.
    Updated iTunesMusicPlayer to add "iTunes" to the pluginButtonImage.

2007-07-27 - 1.0a1 - gnat
    Fix to timer being fired when a device (iPod, CD, HDD, etc..) is mounted.
    An infinite loop was possible that would cause the available playlists to
        not be updated when changes occurred.
    If two consecutive tracks had the same duration, the track info would not
        change when the track changed. Corrected by using the id from iTunes
        rather than the duration.

2007-07-18 - 1.0 - gnat
    Initial release
