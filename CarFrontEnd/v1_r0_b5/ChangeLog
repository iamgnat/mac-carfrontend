    BUG: On larger displays the buttons were not working. The buttons were bound
        to the wrong side of the screen causing them to be pulled under the
        splash view. Corrected the bindings.
    BUG: Artifacting on some displays when the driver side is swapped. Added
        setNeedsDisplay: calls to the mainView which appears to have corrected
        the issue in the test case.

    BUG: Inadvertantly (ok, I was screwing around and forgot about it) changed
        the AppleScript for the Next Track button that caused the screen to
        go black. Returned the script to the proper state.
    BUG: Due to the 1.0a3 NIB changes, the QuickSlot buttons were not calling
        their plugins. Relinked the buttons to the proper action.

    Added driver side selection option to the Menu view.
    Updated the Volume window to pop to the bottom of the screen rather than
        the center. This should make it easier for the user to use.
    Added a title bar to the main window if it is built in Debug mode.

    Update previous track button to skip to the begining of the current track
        if more than 10 seconds have elapsed.
    Added PluginListView to manage new plugin management.
    Updated MainMenu.nib to add a PluginListView to the SystemView view for
        displaying the loaded plugins.
    Updated MainMenu.nib to change the 6 plugin buttons in the MainView to 
        3 QuickSlot buttons to act as quick access to commonly used plugins.
    Updated PluginManager.h/m to add new PluginListView and QuickSlot logic.
    Updated MainViewController to add support for preference management.
    Updated iTunesMusicPlayer to add "iTunes" to the pluginButtonImage.

    Fix to timer being fired when a device (iPod, CD, HDD, etc..) is mounted.
    An infinite loop was possible that would cause the available playlists to
        not be updated when changes occurred.
    If two consecutive tracks had the same duration, the track info would not
        change when the track changed. Corrected by using the id from iTunes
        rather than the duration.
