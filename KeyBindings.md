# Introduction #

As of 1.0a8, CarFrontEnd now allows for binding functionality to key sequences so that users may utilize non-pointing (touch screen/mouse) input devices.

The first section lists all the known key sequences that the user may use and the functionality they provide. The second section provides plugin developers with information on how to use the key binding system.

# Available Key Bindings #

This section shows what Key Bindings are currently available. This is the only section of this document that users need to be concerned with. The first group are keys that are available regardless of any active plugin. The remaining groups detail the keys that work when a specific plugin is active.
